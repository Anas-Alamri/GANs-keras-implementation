# Implementing GANs using keras

I'm new to GANs and a big fan of keras, so I made this project in which I implement as I learn different flavors of generative adverserial neural networks (GANs), I'm using keras with tensorflow back end in jupyter notebooks.

## Good places to understand GANs
This project is all about implemntation, to get a good idea about what are GANs here are some good resources:

## Order of Folders
If you are a beginner with GANs and want to learn step by step the implementation, here is the order of folders to check:
